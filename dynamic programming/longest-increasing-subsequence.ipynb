    "# Longest increasing subsequence\n",
    "1.  any letter can be chosen or not, so the total possibility is 2<sup>N</sup>. Brute force is not a good idea\n",
    "2. to use dynamic programming, the key is to find an optimal value function, typically with the help of intermediate variables\n",
    "3. for arr[0, 1, ...N-1], define L[i], so that L[i] is the lis of arr[0, 1, ...i]. Because arr[i] is the last item, the optimal value function is easy to be calculated. L[i] = max(L[j] + 1) with condition j < i, and arr[i] > arr[j]. \n",

    "Assume arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 3], then\n",
    "1. L[0] = 1, {3}\n",

    "4. L[3] = 2, {1, 2}\n",
    "5. L[4] = 3, {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "1. Line 1 and 2 is straightforward. Line 3: L[2]= l[0] + 1, then L[2] = L[1] + 1 since 4 is larger than 3 and 1. In other words it will be calculated twice but ended up with the same number\n",
    "2. Line 4: since the only smaller number than 2 is 1, then L[3] = L[1] + 1\n",
    "3. Line 5: 3 is larger than 1 and 2 so L[3] will be calculated twice. L[4] = L[2] + 1, then overwritten by L[4] = L[3] +1\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions:\n",
    "The above algorithm will be N<sup>2</sup> due to the inner loop. We could find new ways for binary search to get O(nlogn)"
